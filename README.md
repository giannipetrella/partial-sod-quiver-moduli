# SOD check

This repository is part of the paper "Partial semiorthogonal decomposition
for quiver moduli" of Gianni Petrella.

The code in this repository allows to verify whether Questions A, B and C as described
in the paper hold for any given datum of a quiver `Q` and any dimension vector `d`.

The script `verification.jl` can reproduce all the results for which it is cited in the paper,
while the script `mkronecker-verification.jl` reproduces the results it is cited for
in Proposition 5.2.

To use this code, follow the instructions below.


## Instructions

1. You need a Julia installation.
Install Julia from [the Julia download page](https://julialang.org).

2. Run the Julia REPL in the folder where you wish to save `verification.jl`
and `mkronecker-verification.jl`, and install `QuiverTools` by running

```julia
using Pkg; Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/QuiverTools/QuiverTools.jl.git#commit7068deed83c7de110b84d7dc32ff56bb95f09eff")
```

3. Quit the Julia REPL and in your terminal run

```sh
julia verification.jl
```

4. To verify the claims on m-Kronecker quivers of Proposition 5.2, run

```sh
julia mkronecker-verification.jl
```

### Runtimes

The script `verification.jl` ran in around 30 minutes on a Macbook Pro M1 Pro on battery power.

The script `mkronecker-verification.jl` ran on the same machine for about one hour.
To verify the claim for `m` up to 11, it was let running on a server for several weeks.

## Test other cases

To verify whether any of the questions of the paper holds for your favourite quiver `Q`,
dimension vector `d` and choice of linearisation `a`,
comment out the examples from the paper in `verification.jl` and replace them with yours.
If you don't want to guess a linearisation `a`, `QuiverTools` can find one: use

```julia
a = QuiverTools.extended_gcd(d)[2]
```
