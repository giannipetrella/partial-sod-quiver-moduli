# Verify the conjecture for a given case

The code in this repository is part of the paper "Partial semiorthogonal decomposition
for quiver moduli" of Gianni Petrella.

This code allows to verify whether Questions A, B and C hold for any given datum of a
quiver `Q` and any dimension vector `d`.

To use this code, follow the instructions below.


1. You need a Julia installation.
Install Julia from [the Julia download page](https://julialang.org).

2. from the REPL, install [QuiverTools.jl]{julia.quiver.tools} following the instructions.

3. In your terminal, run

```
julia verification.jl
```
